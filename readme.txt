Galleries on steroids! A stylish plugin for galleries of your public and private WP, Flickr, Picasa, SmugMug, 500px, Zenfolio & Instagram photos.

== Description ==

Photonic lets you use the WordPress <code>gallery</code> shortcode and super-charges it with a lot of added functionality. It adds support for
several new parameters to enhance the content and look-and-feel of your galleries. It supports Flickr photos, Photosets, Galleries and Collections,
along with Picasa photos and albums, SmugMug albums and images, 500px photos and collections, Zenfolio photos, Photosets and Groups, and Instagram photos and users.
You can also enable authentication for your site visitors that will let them see private and protected photos from each provider.

In case you happen to be using a theme or plugin that already overrides the <code>gallery</code>, Photonic provides you with the
option to use your own shortcode for Photonic galleries. This lets your plugins coexist. Bear in mind that if you deactivate Photonic
you will have to remove all instances of this custom shortcode, something that is not required if you stick to the <code>gallery</code> shortcode.

display photos based on popularity, tags, and location-based searches. You can also show thumbnails of users following you or those
followed by you. Some user features require authentication.

= Enhanced Native Galleries =
Your existing gallery insertions are left intact. However you can add a <code>style</code> parameter to it for special effects. The permitted values for <code>style</code> are:

1. <code>strip-below</code>: Displays a thumbnail strip with a running slideshow above.
2. <code>strip-above</code>: Displays a thumbnail strip with a running slideshow below.
3. <code>no-strip</code>: Displays running slideshow with no thumbnails.
4. <code>launch</code>: Doesn't display a running slideshow, but shows all thumbnails. On clicking a thumbnail a popup slideshow is shown.

You can also specify a parameter called <code>fx</code> to add special effects. This parameter can take any of these values: <code>fade</code>
, <code>scrollUp</code>, <code>scrollDown</code>, <code>scrollLeft</code>, <code>scrollRight</code>, <code>scrollHorz</code>, <code>scrollVert</code>
, <code>slideX</code>, <code>slideY</code>, <code>turnUp</code>, <code>turnDown</code>, <code>turnLeft</code>, <code>turnRight</code>, <code>zoom</code>
, <code>fadeZoom</code>, <code>blindX</code>, <code>blindY</code>, <code>blindZ</code>, <code>growX</code>, <code>growY</code>, <code>curtainX</code>
, <code>curtainY</code>, <code>uncover</code>, <code>wipe</code>. See the <a href='http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/'>JQuery Cycle site</a>
for demos of the effects.

Parameters such as <code>speed</code> can control the slide transition speed, and <code>thumbnail_size</code> can control the size of
the thumbnails.

== Installation ==

You can install the plugin through the WordPress installer under <strong>Plugins &rarr; Add New</strong> by searching for it,
or by uploading the file downloaded from here. Alternatively you can download the file from here, unzip it and move the unzipped
contents to the <code>wp-content/plugins</code> folder of your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= If I disable the plugin what happens to the galleries? =

Obviously, your galleries will not show. However, since you are using the native <code>gallery</code> shortcode, you will
not see any empty shortcode tags on your site.

= What about other photo-sharing platforms? =

Suggestions are welcome for other photo-sharing platforms. In addition there will be support provided for the generic
Media RSS format, which can facilitate integration with platforms such as ZenPhoto.

= What about other JS libraries? =

Currently Fancybox, Colorbox and PrettyPhoto are supported. Both lighter and heavier alternatives are being considered.
If you have specific suggestions please feel free to contact the plugin author.

Note that there have been slight modifications to both the above scripts to make them interact with JQuery tooltips.

= Are there any known issues? =

Yes, there are a couple dealing with tooltips. The plugin optionally uses the <a href='http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/'>JQuery Tooltip</a>
script to show image tooltips. The drawback is that for IE7 the native HTML tooltip and the custom tooltip are shown simultaneously.
This is a bug with the thumbnail script.

In addition, if you access a password-protected album in SmugMug in Photonic, you don't get the desired results.

= Are translations supported? =

Yes, but only for the plugin front-end. The admin panel is not translated at this point. Also note that any strings included
in the third-party JS scripts are not translated.
